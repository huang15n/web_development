welcoemto php and MySQL, two of the most important and widely used web develoment tools around 


this will teach you how to create interact web applications from the simplest order from through to complex, secure web applications. try not to leave out any basic conceptsm but we do cover them at speed, this should you give up to speed quickly 


you realize the limitations of this approach. It stays the same unless you physically updte it 
we have deliberately focused this on real world app and how to implement these aspects in PHP. 




# PHP intro 

php is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for the web 
you can embed php code that will be executed each time the page is visisted 
it was conveived in 1994. it was adopted by talented people gone through several major rewrites to bring us the broad, mature product 



php is an open-source project, which means you have access to the source code and have freedom to alter and redisribute it, which is ofically supported 


PHP had well-designed object-oriented features, which continued to be refined and improved in PHP. If you learned to program in Java or C++, you will find the features (and generally the syntax) that you expect, such as inheritance, private and protected attributes and methods, abstract classes and methods, interfaces, constructors, and destructors. You will even find some less common features such as iterators and traits.
PHP allows you to implement simple tasks simply, and equally easily adpats to implementing large apps using a framework based on design patter such as Model View Controller behind the engine powers php 



flexibility, portability, strong oop support, ease of learning and use, scalability, performance, availability 

scale down to something 
commodity servers 
database integration 
built-in libraries 
using the Open Database Connectivity ODBC standard
it was for the general public and it came to fruition 
there were ambitious plans and subsequent complications that made it difficult for the team 

under the hood, it incldues a refactor that powers it, which resulted in a significant performance boost to many apps and remain usable 


# MySQL intro 
MySQL  is a robust relational databse managment system. a dataase enables you to efficiently store, search, sort, and retrieve data 
the server controls access to data to ensure that multiple users can work with it concurrently, to provide fast access to it, and to ensure that only authorized users can obtain access 
hence, MySQL is a multiuser, multihreaded server 
it uses structured query language which has been publicly avaialable  when setting out to build a website 

you may end up with a hybrid architecture with multiple datstores 
these choices are dependent on the others  to be portable between os and web servers 

it is available at no cost 
multicore scalability 
thread pooling 
pluggavle authentication 
plugin API 
event scheduling 
automated upgrades 
diagnostic tools
